# ARcodeAssembler
A utility that converts Action Replay (DS and 3DS) codes into human-readable pseudocode and back.

Kind of a sloppy project I made over two days.

Caveats
* Doesn't support assembling DF (3DS exclusive) or F code types.
* Doesn't support disassembling DF (3DS exclusive), E or F code types.
* Doesn't support assembling button combination codes.

Future ambitions?
* Implement missing code types
* Add support for indentation
* Better UI
* Cleanup assembler since it has stuff leftover from the disassembler
